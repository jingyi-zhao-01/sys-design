# Compliance & Auditability — Non-functional Requirements

## Non-functional requirements

Here the pressure is on:

- Immutability
- Integrity guarantees
- Long-term durability
- Access controls on logs
- Performance at scale
- Regulatory alignment

**Operational considerations:**
- Protect logs from tampering; employ immutability and encryption-at-rest
- Plan for long-term retention and legal hold requirements

> Typical question: “How do you ensure logs themselves are not altered by an attacker?”
