# Compliance & Auditability — Functional Requirements

**Purpose:** make actions provable to third parties.

This is how enterprises justify purchase decisions.

## Functional requirements

The platform must enable:

- Comprehensive event logging
- Actor attribution
- Time ordering
- Retention policies
- Search & export
- Evidence packages
- Chain of custody
- Forensics tooling

## Operational Edge Cases
- **Legal Hold**: Capability to freeze deletion for specific logs or tenants regardless of standard retention policy.
- **PII Redaction**: Post-hoc redaction tool for removing accidental sensitive data while preserving log integrity.

> Notes: Provide tooling to assemble audit evidence packages for regulators and security teams.
